This game was written during [Spring Lisp Game Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2021 "Spring Lisp Game Jam 2021") with [Chickadee](https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html "Chickadee") game development toolkit for Guile Scheme. This is my first attempt to code with any language from Lisp-family and the first game overall.

The pixel arts are mine and the music is by [Rick Hoppmann (TinyWorlds)](https://opengameart.org/users/tinyworlds "Rick Hoppmann (TinyWorlds)").


TODO: I'll try to finish it later with generated mazes, interaction with characters, etc.

### Run

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/kierros/birb/releases) and download tarball with all dependencies `birb-0.1-guix-pack.tar.gz`
2. Unpack the tarball 
`tar -xf birb-0.1-guix-pack.tar.gz`
3. Run the executable 
`./bin/birb`

### Build from source with Guix

To build it with Guix you also need [Chickadee](https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html "Chickadee")
Clone the repo and run the following commands:
1. `guix environment -l /path/to/chickadee/guix.scm -- `
2. `/path/to/chickadee/pre-inst-env guile /path/to/birb/game.scm `
